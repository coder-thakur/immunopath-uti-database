""
""
""
"key molecular markers associated with virulence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli"
"includes"
""
"1. Virulence factors- UPEC strains posses various virulence factors that contribute"
"to their pathogenicity, including:"
""
"•   Adhesins (ex- type 1 ﬁmbriae, P ﬁmbriae) that mediate attachment to host"
"cell."
""
"•   Toxins (ex- α-hemolysin) that damage host cell."
""
"•   Iron acquisition systems (ex- siderophores) that enable UPEC to obtain"
"iron from host."
""
"•   Bioﬁlm formation, which help UPEC evade host immune response and"
"the antimicrobial agents"
""
"2. Phylogenetic groups: UPEC strains is classiﬁed into diMerent phylogenetic"
"groups (A, B1, B2, and D) based on presence of the speciﬁc genetic markers"
"(arpA, chuA, trpA, yjaA, and TSPE4.C2) . These phylogenetic groups are"
"associated with the diMerence in virulence, antimicrobial resiseance, and"
"disease severity."
""
"3. Antimicrobial resistance genes: this strains can harbor various antimicrobial"
"resistance genes, including encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases"
"(ESBLs), which contribute to their ability to cause diMiculties to treat the"
"infections ."
""
"4. Mobile genetic elements: Virulence factors in UPEC are carried by mobile"
"genetic elements, such as the plasmids and the pathogenicity islands, which"
"can facilitate the spread of factors among diMerent E. coli strains"

"The immune response to uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in urinary tract"
"infections (UTIs) are as follows-"
""
"1. Innate immune response: The innate immune system plays crucial role in the"
"host's defense against UPEC infections."
""
"•   UPEC can activate various innate immune pathways, including Toll-like"
"receptors (TLRs), which trigger the release of antimicrobial peptides,"
"cytokines, and chemokines."
""
"•   However, UPEC has developed strategies to evade or suppress the innate"
"immune response, such as modulating host cell signaling and immune"
"cell recruitment."
""
"•   Adaptive immune response: The adaptive immune system also"
"contributes to the host's defense against UPEC infections."
""
"•    UPEC antigens can elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune"
"responses, leading to the production of antibodies and the activation of T"
"cells."
""
"•   The adaptive immune response can help clear UPEC infections and"
"prevent recurrent UTIs, but it may also contribute to the development of"
"renal scarring in some cases."
""
"2. Immune evasion and persistence: UPEC has evolved various mechanisms to"
"evade the host's immune response and persist within the urinary tract."
""
"•   UPEC can adhere to and invade host cells, forming intracellular bacterial"
"communities that are protected from immune recognition and clearance."
""
"•   UPEC can also modulate the host's immune response, suppressing the"
"activation of immune cells and the production of antimicrobial factors."
""
"3. Vaccine development: Understanding the complex interplay between UPEC and"
"the host's immune system is crucial for the development of eMective vaccines"
"against UTIs."
""
"•   Vaccines targeting key UPEC virulence factors and eliciting a protective"
"immune response could help prevent and treat UPEC-associated UTIs."

"The occurrence of E. aerogenes in UTIs varies across different studies and regions:"
""
"    In Iran, a study was found that E. aerogenes was one of the most important Enterobacteriaceae species isolated"
"from UTIs, with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains."
""
"    The occurrence of E. aerogenes in UTIs is relatively lower in Nigeria, ranging from 10-27%."
""
"    A study reported that E. aerogenes accounted for 10% of nosocomial and community-acquired UTIs in Spain."
""
"    In Japan, E. aerogenes was found to be a predominant species among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae"
"(CRE) infections, including UTIs."
""
"    In Benin, E. aerogenes was one of the Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from UTIs, and the study showed the"
"susceptibility and virulence factors of these isolates."
""
"    In a study of school-age children in Iraq, E. aerogenes was identified as one of the common pathogens causing UTIs,"
"after Escherichia coli."
"The epidemiology of E. aerogenes in UTIs is influenced by various factors, such as antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, and"
"host susceptibility. E. aerogenes can employ immune evasion mechanisms and form reservoirs within the host, ultimately"
"contributing to its persistence and prevalence in UTIs."
""
"Overall, the available evidence shows that E. aerogenes is an emerging uropathogen with a significant prevalence in UTIs,"
"particularly in certain geographical regions and patient populations."

"IMMUNE RESPONSE"
""
""
""
"Candida dubliniensis is a dimorphic yeast that has gained significance over the last decade"
"because it can trigger an aggressive host immune response. In comparison to the closely related"
"Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis is different in its capacity to stimulate the immune system,"
"although the differences are likely too minor to lead to clinically relevant consequences."
""
"A number of studies have examined the immune response to C. dubliniensis. C. dubliniensis has"
"been found to be able to trigger a trained innate immune response, which is capable of"
"protecting against sepsis. This trained immunity is mediated by the infiltration of Gr-1+ cells,"
"including granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, into the bone marrow."
"Also, C. dubliniensis has been reported to be linked with periodontitis in young adults and"
"adolescents, indicating its capacity to interact with the host immune system within the oral"
"cavity."
""
"Scientists have also studied the use of C. dubliniensis-derived molecules, like mannan, as targets"
"for immunization and assessing the efficacy of immune responses."
""
"On the whole, the evidence at hand suggests that C. dubliniensis is able to provoke a unique"
"immune response, especially during sepsis and oral infections, but the precise mechanisms and"
"clinical significance need to be explored further."

""
""
"the immune response to BK virus-associated urinary tract infections (BKV-UTI):"
""
"the BK virus-associated urinary tract infections (BKV-UTI) immune response:"
""
"1.Innate Immune Response:"
""
"•Innate immunity is the key first line of defense against BKV infection in the urinary tract."
""
"•BK virus infection triggers the innate immune response, such as the generation of"
"proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which serves to check viral replication and spread."
""
"•The bladder urothelial cells show BK channel activity, which plays a key role in the innate"
"immune response to BKV-UTI."
""
"2.Adaptive Immune Response:"
""
"•BKV-specific cellular and humoral immunity are necessary for suppressing BKV infection and"
"avoiding BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) development."
""
"•In healthy individuals, the adaptive immune system can usually suppress BKV infection, and the"
"virus mostly remains latent in the urinary tract."
""
"•But in immunocompromised patients, like transplant recipients, the compromised adaptive"
"immune response may result in the reactivation of BKV and the onset of BKVAN."
""
"3.Pathogenesis of BKV-UTI:"
""
"•BK virus infection usually begins in the kidney and spreads to the urinary tract, including the"
"bladder."
""
"•BKV replication within the urinary tract, particularly in the context of prior tissue injury, may"
"contribute to the formation of BKV-UTI and BKVAN."
""
"•In certain instances, BKV infection can also be linked with the onset of bladder urothelial"
"carcinoma among transplant recipients."
""
"In conclusion, the immune response to BKV-UTI is an intricate interaction between the innate"
"and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune response, especially the urothelial BK channel"
"activity, is vital for the initial defense against BKV infection. The adaptive immune response, such"
"as BKV-specific cellular and humoral immunity, is crucial for the control of BKV infection and the"
"prevention of BKVAN, particularly in immunocompromised hosts."

""
"the epidemiology of BK virus-associated urinary tract infections (BKV-UTI):"
""
"The BK virus (BKV) is a ubiquitous polyomavirus which mainly infects the urinary system. BKV"
"infection is widely distributed in the general population with seroprevalence levels of 60-90% by"
"adulthood."
""
"BKV infection usually begins in the kidneys and may subsequently spread to the urinary tract,"
"such as the bladder. In healthy individuals, the virus mainly exists in a latent state in the urinary"
"tract."
"But in immunocompromised patients, like transplant recipients, the compromised adaptive"
"immune system can cause the reactivation of BKV and the onset of BKV-associated nephropathy"
"(BKVAN) and BKV-UTI."
""
"The incidence of BKV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis (BKV-HC) among stem cell transplant"
"recipients has been estimated to be approximately 12.8%. In pediatric hematopoietic stem cell"
"transplant (HSCT) patients, the incidence of BKV-HC has been reported to be 1-12%."
""
"Risk factors for the acquisition of BKV-UTI and BKVAN are the receipt of immunosuppressive"
"agents, particularly in the context of organ transplant, and host characteristics such as"
"advancing age and selected genetic polymorphisms."
""
"In the general population, the incidence of BKV DNA in urine specimens has been noted to be"
"approximately 61 of 168 samples (36.3%). But the detection of BKV DNA in the urine does not"
"always reflect active disease or infection because the virus can also be detected in a latent form."
""
"In short, BKV is an extremely common virus that can induce severe morbidity in"
"immunocompromised patients, especially in the form of BKV-UTI and BKVAN. The epidemiology"
"of BKV-UTI is marked by increased prevalence among transplant recipients and"
"immunocompromised hosts with diverse risk factors being responsible for the occurrence of the"
"disease."

"immune response of uti causing adeno virus"":"
""
"The immune response to adenovirus (HAdV) infections in the urinary tract involves both the"
"innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the"
"initial response, with antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic viruses like adenovirus."
"However, adenoviruses can also modulate the host's immune response, with the E1 and E3"
"regions of the viral genome impacting various aspects of the host's immune response."
""
"In immunocompromised patients, e.g., transplant recipients, adenovirus infections may"
"significantly affect the immune system, resulting in a reduced cell-mediated immune response"
"and a higher rate of opportunistic infections, including urinary tract infections."
""
"However, in immunocompetent hosts, adenoviral infections have the ability to cause an"

""
"The adaptive immune response of the urinary tract is also functional and can induce protective"
"immunity against UTIs. The presence of immune surveillance molecules is important for this"
"response."
""
"In general, the immune response to adenovirus-associated UTIs is multifaceted and may engage"

"the epidemiology of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs):"
""
"The epidemiology of CMV-related UTIs among adult kidney transplant patients is that the risk of"
"CMV infection ranges significantly, from 5-30% for those who are CMV IgG Recipient-positive."
"The time to clinically symptomatic CMV infection is generally within one year post-"
"transplantation."
""
"The incidence of CMV nephritis, one type of CMV disease in the kidney, is low, approximately"
"0.2% in kidney transplant recipients. Risk factors for CMV nephritis involve concomitant"
"infection, including BK viremia, UTI, and pneumonia."
""
"In the general population, congenital CMV infection prevalence has been stable over the last 6"
"decades, with a linear trend noted between countries with universal screening programs."
"CMV is among the prevalent viruses that may result in UTIs in renal transplant recipients, with"
"the BK virus being another common one. The rate of CMV infection among this population has"
"been reported to be between 14%."
""
"Risk factors associated with CMV-related UTIs in renal transplant recipients include diabetes"
"mellitus and a history of previous CMV infection. CMV infection has also been linked to an"
"increased risk of recurrent UTIs in this patient population."
""
"In conclusion, the epidemiology of CMV infection-associated UTIs in adult kidney transplant"
"recipients is variable with an incidence of 5-30%, with a median time to clinically evident"
"infection within the first posttransplant year. CMV nephritis is relatively low with an incidence of"
"approximately 0.2%, and CMV is one of the viruses commonly causing UTIs in renal transplant"
"recipients, although the BK virus is also common. Risk factors for UTIs due to CMV are diabetes"
"mellitus and a history of prior CMV infection."

"immune response"
""
""
""
"the immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that can cause urinary tract"
"infections (UTIs):"
""
"The immune system is responsible for recognizing and fighting HPV infections, but HPV has built"
"up a range of mechanisms to escape the immune defenses of the host."
""
"HPV infection does not normally induce a strong inflammatory response, which is an important"
"danger signal to alert the innate immune system."
"HPV also can cause immune tolerance, which results in an impaired cellular immune response"
"and an imbalance in the immune system."
""
"Specific immune responses, including CD8+ T-cell responses against HPV oncoproteins E6 and"
"E7, play critical roles in eliminating HPV infection. Nevertheless, HPV has developed means to"
"escape such adaptive immune responses."
""
"The immune response to HPV infections is frequently limited to the site of infection, e.g., the"
"genital tract. Genital tract concentrations of HPV-specific IgA antibodies may serve as a marker"
"of the local immune response."
""
"Although the immune system clears most HPV infections, a portion of infections become"
"persistent and lead to HPV-associated cancers, including urinary tract cancers."
""
"The immune response of the body to HPV infections can be determined by a number of factors,"
"including aging, and this can cause alterations in mucosal immunity and susceptibility to"
"diseases caused by HPV, such as UTIs."
""
"In conclusion, the immune response to the HPV infections that lead to UTIs is both innate and"
"adaptive immunity, but HPV has developed mechanisms to evade and inhibit the host's immune"
"response, resulting in chronic infections and possible disease development"
